# Machine Learning Specialization: Handwritten Notes

This repository contains my handwritten notes for the **Machine Learning Specialization** offered on Coursera. The course, led by renowned instructors, covers fundamental and advanced topics in machine learning. My notes provide detailed summaries of each lecture and highlight important algorithms, techniques, and theoretical insights.

## About This Project

These notes were taken from the lectures in the **Machine Learning Specialization**, which is structured into three main courses. You can view the specialization [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction).

### Project Highlights

- **Comprehensive 3-Course Summary**: Covers essential concepts from regression and classification to reinforcement learning and advanced algorithms.
- **69 Pages of Handwritten Notes**: Key ideas, formulas, and algorithms presented concisely for each course.
- **Designed for Beginners and Practitioners**: Topics are structured to assist both newcomers and those reinforcing their knowledge.

## Specialization Contents

### 1. Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

This course covers the foundational principles of supervised learning and focuses on building basic models to predict and classify data:

- **Linear Regression**: Modeling relationships between variables, using simple and multiple linear regression to make predictions on continuous data.
- **Gradient Descent Optimization**: Techniques to minimize error and improve the accuracy of models through iterative parameter tuning.
- **Regularization**: Strategies to prevent overfitting in complex models.
- **Logistic Regression for Binary Classification**: Methods to tackle classification tasks and predict categorical outcomes.
- **Practical Application**: Implementing models in Python with libraries such as NumPy and scikit-learn.

### 2. Advanced Learning Algorithms

This course delves into more complex algorithms, providing tools for higher accuracy and handling larger datasets:

- **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**: Introduction to basic neural network architectures and concepts, including forward and backward propagation.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Methods to optimize model parameters for better performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Strategies to measure model accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure optimal performance on new data.
- **Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods**: How to use decision trees and ensemble techniques like random forests to create more robust models.

### 3. Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning

This final course introduces unsupervised learning methods, recommendation systems, and the basics of reinforcement learning:

- **Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques like k-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to discover patterns in unlabeled data.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Algorithms to predict user preferences and suggest relevant items, using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization.
- **Reinforcement Learning Basics**: Introduction to core reinforcement learning concepts, including Q-learning and policy gradients.
- **Real-World Applications**: Practical projects and exercises that apply these techniques to AI challenges, preparing learners to implement these models in real-world scenarios.
